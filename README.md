Library for text localisation, which is built into the application at the development stage.

Supporting multiple languages in your application is a good idea. But what if during the development phase you do not yet know the complete list of languages that your application will support? Or perhaps the localisation of your application will be created by enthusiasts? The basis for the modification of the text portion of the user interface is better to lay on the stage of development. And this library will help with this.
